Question Statement
You are given a sorted array nums containing distinct positive integers. The task is to find the kth missing positive integer from the sequence of natural numbers.

Solution Explanation
Problem Requirements:

The difference between a number's value and its position in the array determines how many numbers are missing up to that point:
nums[mid] - (mid + 1) gives the count of missing numbers before index mid.
Use binary search to efficiently find the smallest index where the missing count matches or exceeds k.
Approach:

Use binary search to locate the point where the kth missing positive number lies:
If the missing count at mid is greater than or equal to k, move to the left half.
Otherwise, move to the right half.
Returning the Result:

After the loop, e represents the index where there are just fewer than k missing numbers.
Use the formula e + k + 1 to compute the kth missing number, as the result lies after index e.
Complexity Analysis
Time Complexity:
Binary Search: The search space is the length of the array, taking O(log(n)).
Total: O(log(n)).
Space Complexity:

The space complexity is O(1) as no extra data structures are used.
